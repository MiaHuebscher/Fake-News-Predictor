This is the first solo coding project I ever produced.

The code analyzes key differences between the title features of real news and fake news. It then utilizes these differences to predict whether an article is real or fake based on its title. The program next makes use of a Naive Bayes algorithm to produce a more reliable prediction for the user with 94.911% accuracy. 

The data sets used to construct this code come from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset
